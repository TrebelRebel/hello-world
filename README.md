I am just following instructions from teh GitHub tutorial
My name is Anthony Conradi, I am about to turn 26 and I have done absolutely nothing with my life.
I feel lost and hopeless and don't know where to start because no one really ever pointed me in a certain direction.
So I guess I'll start here and move onto programming. I will eventually put myself into school.
For now I will do what I can on my own and I will look for a job while trying to stay positive and keeping the toxic out of my life.
I haven't had tacos on the moon so I wouldn't know if they were superior to earth tacos or not.
